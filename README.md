# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### What I learned

I learned how to style placeholders and add images as backgrounds.

```css
::placeholder {
  color: hsl(184, 14%, 56%);
}

ol li #custom-tip::placeholder {
  color: hsl(186, 14%, 43%);
  font-size: 1.375rem;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0.3125rem;
  left: 0.625rem;
}

#left-section input {
  background-image: url("images/icon-dollar.svg");
}
```
